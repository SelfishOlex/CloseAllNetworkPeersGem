# "Close All Network Peers" Gem
A gem for Amazon Lumberyard to close all network peers. Useful for local multi player testing.

# Problem
Let's say you are tesing a multiplayer application locally. You wrote a script to launch the server and two clients. Whenever you are done with the testing, you have to close each of the clients and the server, right? Ever get tired of repeating that over and over?

# Solution
Would it not be nice to have a console command that would close all of them regardless if you called that command from the server or from any of the connected clients?

Now you can:

> closeallnetworkpeers

# Notes
Works with Lumberyard 1.11
